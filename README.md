# About me

Hello there! Welcome to a sparse landing page with some links to stuff I'm tinkering with.

## My background

Started being interested in using ML for music understanding back in computer science school around 2011 from the ANN side with Boltzmann machines and Hinton.

Picked up Theano when Lasagne/Keras was coming up, and was a regular contributor to Keras and TensorFlow before the 1.0 release. Sad about 2.0 as a functional programmer, and now moving to PyTorch like everyone else.

Touched a lot of deep learning models, especially around audio, most recently time-domain diffusion. My claim to fame was polyphonic pitch detection expressed as semantic segmentation of synthesised piano rolls.

Generally mostly focused on representation learning by self-supervision, and applying differentiable programming in digital signal processing for next-level audio products and music production tools.
