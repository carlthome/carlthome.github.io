# About me

Hello there! Welcome to a little landing page with some links to stuff I'm tinkering with.

## My background

Used to play guitar when I was young. Became interested in using machine learning for music understanding in computer science school around 2011 from the artificial neural networks side.

Picked up Theano when Lasagne/Keras was coming up and was a regular contributor to Keras and TensorFlow before 1.0. Sad about 2.0 as an aspiring functional programmer, but now moving to PyTorch like everyone else.

I've touched a lot of deep learning models, particularly around audio (most recently time-domain diffusion). My little claim to fame is polyphonic pitch detection expressed as semantic segmentation of synthesised piano rolls.

Generally interested in representation learning by self-supervision, and applying differentiable programming to digital signal processing for next-level audio products and music production tools.

I'm currently thinking about audio-based finetuning methods, reproducible code for scientific computing, and whether I should study philosophy & plumbing instead.
